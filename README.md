Namecoin presentation

This began life as a presentation to domain investors to generate interest in next generation DNS'es. 
There was zero interest. There still seems to be zero interest. 
The intended audience is firmly clinging to the status quo, so now this needs to speak to a broader audience.

The primary audience for this Namecoin preso should be those concerned with protecting online privacy, 
and by extension free speech online. A secondary audience is the communities interested in improving security on the Internet, 
in particular the most presing security issues, around Man-in-the-middle attacks, 
which are routinely used by malicious entities, governments and even learge companies.

In particular I'd like to scrub all references to using proxies and Meowbit to resolve .bit domains.
I'd like to add some content about DNSChain as well, and plans for making FreeSpeechMe more robust.
